Not the best optimzed but it does what I needed it to do.

TabvSaverPlainText.py

this will focus and maximize your firefox window.

and on a 0.5 second sleep, will do the following:

CTRL + L to focux address bar

CTRL + C to copy the URL

CTRL + Tab to switch to the next tab

and will cycle through this until it reaches the first tab again.


It then prints the links in a file named open_tab_links.txt


TabOpenerPlainText.py


This will open and read open_tab_links.txt and open each individual link that was saved.
